	•	SELECT	*	FROM	DEPT_SUMMARY;

	This query is valid for the view 
	Output:
		D  C  TOTAL_S  AVERAGE_S
		-  -  -------  ---------
		1  1  55000    55000.0  
		4  3  93000    31000.0  
		5  4  133000   33250.0  


	•	SELECT D, C	FROM DEPT_SUMMARY	WHERE TOTAL_S > 100000;

	This is a valid query
	Output: 
		D  C
		-  -
		5  4  

	•	SELECT  D, AVG_S	FROM  DEPT_SUMMARY	 WHERE  C > (SELECT C FROM DEPT_SUMMARY WHERE D = 4);
	Not a valid query because AVG_S is not a column. To fix this err change AVG_S -> AVERAGE_S. Then the output would look like:
		D  AVERAGE_S
		-  ---------
		5  33250.0 

	•	UPDATE DEPT_SUMMARY		set  D=3		WHERE  D= 4;
  Not a valid query because you cannot update records using a view.

	•	DELETE FROM DEPT_SUMMARY	WHERE C > 4;

	Not a valid query because you cannot delete records using a view.
